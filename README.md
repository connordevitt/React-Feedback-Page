# React Feedback Page

Follow these steps to setup the React feedback page.

## Steps to Set Up

### 1. Create a New React Project Using Vite

Run the following command to create a new React app using the Vite template:

```bash
npm create vite@latest feedback-page --template react
```

### 2. Navigate to the Project Directory

Once the project is created, navigate to the feedback-page directory:

```bash
cd feedback-page
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

Now, install the necessary dependencies by running:

```bash

npm install
```

### 4. Start the Development Server

After the dependencies are installed, start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Your React app will now be running at http://localhost:5173.

Project Structure
The basic project structure will look like this:

src/ - Contains the main application code, including components and pages.
index.html - The HTML template for the app.
vite.config.js - Configuration file for Vite (bundling, plugins, etc.).
Available Scripts
Once the project is set up, the following npm scripts are available:

npm run dev: Starts the development server with hot-reloading.
npm run build: Builds the app for production (optimized and minified).
npm run preview: Previews the production build locally.

React - JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
Vite - Fast build tool and development server.
